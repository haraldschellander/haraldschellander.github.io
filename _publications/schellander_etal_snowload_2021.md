The European Committee for Standardization defines zonings and calculation criteria for different European regions to assign snow loads for structural design. In the Alpine region these defaults are quite coarse; countries therefore use their own products, and inconsistencies at national borders are a common problem.

A new methodology to derive a snow load map for Austria is presented, which is reproducible and could be used across borders. It is based on (i) modeling snow loads with the specially developed Δsnow model at 897 sophistically quality controlled snow depth series in Austria and neighboring countries and (ii) a generalized additive model where covariates and their combinations are represented by penalized regression splines, fitted to series of yearly snow load maxima derived in the first step. This results in spatially modeled snow load extremes.

The new approach outperforms a standard smooth model and is much more accurate than the currently used Austrian snow load map when compared to the RMSE of the 50-year snow load return values through a cross-validation procedure. No zoning is necessary, and the new map's RMSE of station-wise estimated 50-year generalized extreme value (GEV) return levels gradually rises to 2.2 kN m−2 at an elevation of 2000 m. The bias is 0.18 kN m−2 and positive across all elevations. When restricting the range of validity of the new map to 2000 m elevation, negative bias values that significantly underestimate 50-year snow loads at a very small number of stations are the only objective problem that has to be solved before the new map can be proposed as a successor of the current Austrian snow load map.
