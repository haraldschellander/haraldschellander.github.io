At GeoSphere Austria we develop solutions for applied engineering problems related to natural hazards. 
We provide basic tools for decision makers and stakeholders to react on impact based warnings and climate change adaption processes.

I work at the interface between climatology, hydrology and statistics, with an emphasis on (spatial) extremes. 

# Current research topics
- Statistics of meteorological extremes
- Physical process based snow models 
- Climatology of snow and related processes
- Geospatial statistics
