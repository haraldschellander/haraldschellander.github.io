At GeoSphere Austria we develop solutions for applied engineering problems related to natural hazards. 
We provide basic tools for decision makers and stakeholders to react on impact based warnings and climate change adaption processes.
Recently I have been focusing on the development of AI-based solutions to improve the efficiency of forecasters and decision makers in the field of natural hazards.

I work at the interface between climatology, hydrology and statistics, with an emphasis on (spatial) extremes. 

# Current research topics
- AI-based improvements of forecaster efficiency
- Statistics of meteorological extremes
- Climatology of snow and related processes
- Physical process based snow models 
- Geospatial statistics
