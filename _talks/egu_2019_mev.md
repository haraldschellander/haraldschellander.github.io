SThe wrong estimation of daily rainfall extremes can have severe consequences in hydrological and engineering
applications. Up to date, the Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV) is considered the de-facto standard
for the estimation of daily rainfall extremes, although there exist some evidence that fitting yearly maxima might
violate the asymptotic assumption underlying extreme value theory.
To overcome this problem, the Metastatistical Extreme Value distribution (MEV) was recently proposed.
With the MEV, the distribution of the bulk of the daily rainfall data ("ordinary events") is considered to be Weibull
right-tail equivalent, describing the intensity of daily rainfall. By additionally considering the number of wet days
in a year as random variable, daily rainfall occurrence can be taken into account simultaneously. Recent advances
in the study of extreme rainfall showed that the MEV should be preferred over the GEV for the estimation of daily
rainfall extremes, whenever the number of years used for fitting is small compared to the return period of interest.
In the present study, a break-even analysis for a large number of sample years and return periods for Aus-
trian daily rainfall data shows that the MEV outperforms the GEV when the number of sample years is smaller
than, and the estimated return period is larger than 30 years. This advantage almost vanishes when smooth spatial
extreme value modeling is performed with the MEV instead of the GEV. However, the computational effort is
drastically decreased when using an averaged version of the MEV.
